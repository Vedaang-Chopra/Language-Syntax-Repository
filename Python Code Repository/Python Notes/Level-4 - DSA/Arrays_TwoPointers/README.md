- Solve 50+ related LeetCode problems independently

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

| Module | Notebook | Focus | Problems |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| **1** | `01_opposite_ends_basics` | Converging pointers | Reverse String, Valid Palindrome, Two Sum II, Three Sum |
| **1B** | `02_container_water` | Greedy elimination | Container Water, Trapping Rain Water |
| **2** | `03_partitioning` | Read/Write pointers | Move Zeroes, Remove Duplicates, Sort Colors |
| **2B** | `04_merging_logic` | Merge from end | Merge Sorted Array, Squares, Intersection |
| **3** | `05_floyds_array` | Fast & Slow | Find Duplicate, Happy Number, Circular Loop |
| **4** | `06_fixed_window` | Fixed size k | Max Sum, Threshold, Permutation, Max Cards |
| **5** | `07_dynamic_longest` | Expand → Shrink | Max Ones, No Repeat, Char Replace, K Distinct |
| **5B** | `08_dynamic_shortest` | Shrink when valid | Min Subarray, Min Window Substring/Subsequence |
| **6** | `09_sliding_window_aux` | Advanced structures | Monotonic Deque, atMost(k) trick |

## 🚀 How to Use

### Learning Path
```
Module 1 → 1B → 2 → 2B → 3 → 4 → 5 → 5B → 6
```

### For Each Notebook
1. **Read** the Conceptual Notes carefully
2. **Complete** the Warm-Up exercises first
3. **Implement** each problem from the TODO scaffolding
4. **Run** the test cases to verify
5. **Answer** the Reflection Questions
6. **Attempt** Practice Problems for reinforcement

### High Friction Approach
- Solutions are NOT provided - you must implement them
- TODOs guide you through the logic
- Tests verify correctness immediately
- This forces active recall and deep understanding

## 📊 Problem Count

- **31 Main Problems** (LeetCode classics)
- **7 Warm-Up Exercises** (confidence builders)
- **7 Practice Problems** (extensions)
- **Total: 45+ coding exercises**

## 🔗 Pattern Recognition Guide

| If you see... | Use this pattern |
|---------------|------------------|
| Sorted array + target sum | Opposite Ends |
| In-place removal/partition | Read/Write pointers |
| Cycle detection | Fast & Slow |
| Fixed window size k | Fixed Sliding Window |
| "Longest/Maximum" with constraint | Dynamic Window (Longest) |
| "Shortest/Minimum" with constraint | Dynamic Window (Shortest) |
| "Exactly K" problems | atMost(k) - atMost(k-1) |
