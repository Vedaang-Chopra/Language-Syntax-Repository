  - [ ] Understanding variable assignments and type inference
  - [ ] Learn about variable naming conventions and best practices

## Operators

- [ ] **Arithmetic Operators** (+, -, *, /, %, //, **)

- [ ] **Logical Operators** (and, or, not)
- [ ] **Assignment Operators** (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
- [ ] **Membership Operators** (in, not in)
- [ ] **Identity Operators** (is, is not)

## Control Flow

- [ ] **Conditionals (if-elif-else)**
  - [ ] Practice basic conditional logic and nested conditionals
- [ ] **Loops**
  - [ ] Understand `for` loops to iterate over sequences (list, tuple, dict)
  - [ ] Practice using `while` loops for repetitive tasks
- [ ] **Loop Control**
  - [ ] Learn and practice `break` and `continue` in loops

## Functions

- [ ] **Defining Functions**
  - [ ] Learn how to define functions using `def`
  - [ ] Understand function arguments (positional, keyword, default)
  - [ ] Use return statements in functions to return values
- [ ] **Lambda Functions**
  - [ ] Practice defining anonymous functions using `lambda`
  - [ ] Understand how lambda can be used with map(), filter(), and reduce()

## Data Structures

- [ ] **Lists**
  - [ ] Learn about list operations (append, remove, pop, slicing)
  - [ ] Practice using list comprehensions for efficient operations

- [ ] **Tuples**
  - [ ] Understand tuple immutability and how to use them for fixed data

- [ ] **Dictionaries**
  - [ ] Learn how to create dictionaries and access values by keys
  - [ ] Practice using dict methods like get(), update(), keys(), and values()

- [ ] **Sets**
  - [ ] Learn about set operations (add, remove, intersection, union, etc.)

## Input/Output

- [ ] **User Input**
  - [ ] Learn how to use `input()` to accept input from users
  - [ ] Practice converting input into different types

- [ ] **File I/O**
  - [ ] Learn how to open files using `open()`, read from files, and write to files
  - [ ] Understand file modes ('r', 'w', 'a') and practice file handling

## Exception Handling

- [ ] **Basic Exception Handling**
  - [ ] Learn how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` to handle errors
  - [ ] Practice raising custom exceptions using `raise`

## Latest Python Concepts (3.10-3.12)

- [ ] **Match-Case (Structural Pattern Matching)**
  - [ ] Learn and practice the `match-case` syntax for complex conditions

- [ ] **f-Strings**
  - [ ] Practice using f-strings for string formatting

- [ ] **Improved Error Messages**
  - [ ] Explore new error message formats introduced in Python 3.12

## Practice Projects

- [ ] Build a **simple calculator** that takes user input and performs operations
- [ ] Write a **to-do list application** using lists and dictionaries
- [ ] Create a Python script to **process CSV files** (reading and writing)
- [ ] Implement a **basic web scraper** using `requests` or `beautifulsoup`
